GAME OVERVIEW:
PEW PEW is a game that allows 2 players to run and jump while
shooting bullets and avoiding being shot at.

Powerup Mushrooms appear and can grant the player more health
while bullets deplete it

Power Ups:
Red Mushroom: Gives the Player 30 health back
Blue Mushroom: Doubles the Player's Jump Power
Green Mushroom: Doubles the Player's Speed
Purple Mushroom: Doubles the Player's Damage

Power ups will last until the player picks up another power up. For example, if the player gets the health power up, there health will be boosted,
and all other effects will turn off.




Collision:

If a shot makes contact with the other player, points are scored
and that player loses 10 health unless boosted. The Players base health
is 100.



Scoring:
The score is a way for the players to keep track of how many times they 
have hit the other player. 
 
Once a player is out of health the game is over
